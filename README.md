```lrc
[00:09.80] Sitting in the morning sun
[00:13.71] I'll be sitting when the evening comes
[00:19.11] Watching the ships roll in
[00:23.13] And I'll watch 'em roll away again
[00:40.13] 
[00:28.03] I'm sitting at the dock of the bay
[00:31.79] Watching the tide roll away
[00:37.19] I'm just sitting at the dock of the bay
[00:41.07] Wasting time
[00:47.07] 
[00:46.85] I left my home in Georgia
[00:51.00] Heading for the Frisco Bay
[00:55.43] 'Cause I have nothing to live for
[00:59.34] It looks like nothing's gonna come my way
[01:19.84] 
[01:04.56] I'm sitting at the dock of the bay
[01:08.29] Watching the tide roll away, ooh
[01:13.68] I'm sitting at the dock of the bay
[01:17.51] Wasting time
[01:23.51] 
[01:24.09] Look out, nothing's gonna change
[01:28.56] Everything still remain the same
[01:32.54] I can't do what ten people tell me to do
[01:37.49] So I guess, I'll remain the same
[01:53.49] 
[01:41.59] Sitting, resting my bones, oh
[01:46.33] This loneliness won't leave me alone
[01:50.70] Two thousand miles, I roam
[01:54.96] Just to make this dock my home
[02:09.96] 
[01:59.69] I'm sitting at the dock of the bay
[02:03.37] Watching the tide roll away, ooh
[02:08.89] I'm sitting at the dock of the bay
[02:12.54] Wasting time
